## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.10+
* pip
* Git

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afzal-10-02/quiz_master_23f3003203.git
```

```bash
cd quiz_master_23f3003203
```

---

### 2. Create a virtual environment

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask application runs on:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

The application is configured to run on port `5000`.

---

## Default Admin Account

The application initializes an administrator account during database setup.

For security, **do not use hardcoded credentials in a production deployment**. Change the credentials and move sensitive configuration into environment variables before deploying publicly.

---

## Authentication

Quiz Master uses **Flask-Login** for authentication and session management.

The application provides separate flows for:

* User login
* User registration
* Admin authentication
* Logout
* Protected routes

---

## Performance & Statistics

The application stores quiz attempts and scores in the database, allowing user performance to be analyzed over time.

**Matplotlib** is included in the project dependencies for generating data visualizations and statistical representations.

---

## Security Considerations

Before deploying this project to production, consider the following:

* Move the Flask secret key to environment variables.
* Never commit passwords or secrets to Git.
* Use strong production credentials.
* Disable Flask debug mode.
* Use HTTPS in production.
* Add CSRF protection for form submissions.
* Validate and sanitize user input.
* Use production-grade database configuration.
* Configure secure session cookies.

> **Note:** The current source contains a hardcoded Flask secret key and a default administrator password. These should be changed before production deployment.

---

## Future Improvements

Some possible improvements include:

* [ ] REST API for quiz operations
* [ ] JWT-based API authentication
* [ ] Password reset functionality
* [ ] Email notifications
* [ ] Question randomization
* [ ] Multiple question types
* [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
* [ ] Leaderboard system
* [ ] Quiz categories and difficulty levels
* [ ] Export results to CSV/PDF
* [ ] Responsive UI improvements
* [ ] Docker support
* [ ] Automated testing
* [ ] CI/CD pipeline
* [ ] Production deployment

---
